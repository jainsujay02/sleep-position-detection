# Sleep Position Detector
Developed a prototype sleep position device with motion pattern recognition for clinical settings through a CNN embedded on ARM-architecture-based STM SensorTile (C/C++). It identifies and records the user's sleep position, providing feedback to the caregiver in real-time on the relative safety of the sleep position.
